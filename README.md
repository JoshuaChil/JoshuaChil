# Hey there! I'm Joshua Chilukuri! 

I'm an engineer whose deeply excited about AI-interfaces, human-computer interaction, and software development. I'm currently an AR + AI researcher at Duke University (published in IEEE ISMAR, 2025), and co-founder of Hiant, a team collaborating with statewide non-profits (totaling 20K+ members) to deploy member management software. I love how technology can be used to augment human capabilities. Outside of computers, I also actively engage in policy initiatives, eager to be civically engaged and also examine the legal and ethical implications of the tools I build.  

## 🚀 About Me

- 📷👓🤖 **Engineering Interest**: Currently exploring Smart Glasses Software, backed by Intel Corporation (Intel Global AI Awardee, 2025). I designed a perception architecture leveraging depth mapping algorithms + object detection and LLMs to enable metrically depth-aware navigation for the visually impaired. Next step: exploring how Edge-VLMs can be utilized to deploy a working system that doesn't stream private daily life over the web. 
- ⭐ **Learning Goals (2026)**: Full-stack deployment/scaling (Docker, Kubernetes), Multi-Modal AI and Perception Models, AR Systems.
- 🏛️📚🎸🏋️ **Beyond Building**: If I'm not building new ideas, catch me engaging in policy as a member of North Carolina's Student Gov. University System, reading (biographies!), practicing the guitar, or weight-lifting!
